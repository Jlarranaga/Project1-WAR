# Project1-WAR

**WAR**

**OVERVIEW**
This is the card game War. 2 players split a card deck and each put 1 card down. Whichever player has the higher rank wins and gets both cards. If both players put down an equal rank card they go to war. They each put down 3 cards and then the 4th card duels. The winner takes all 4 cards from their opponent. You win by taking all opponents cards or opponent surrenders.

* start the game when I'm ready
* put down each card when I'm ready
* surrender if I wish
* play till the end of the game
* play again keeping score of who won previous games
